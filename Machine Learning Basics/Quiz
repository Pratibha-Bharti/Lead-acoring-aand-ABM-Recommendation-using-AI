1.) What is Machine Learning?

1 What is the primary goal of machine learning?

The primary goal of machine learning is to replace human decision-making entirely.
The primary goal of machine learning is to enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks over time.   -->yes
The primary goal of machine learning is to create machines that can perform only a single task.


2 What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?

Supervised learning only uses unlabeled data and does not require any correct answers during training.
Unsupervised learning analyzes unlabeled data to discover patterns or relationships without explicit output labels.      --> yes
Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are interchangeable terms with no distinct differences.
Supervised learning involves training models on labeled data, where the correct answers are provided, and the model learns to map input data to output labels.     --> yes


3. Select two examples of applications for machine learning in real-world scenarios.
